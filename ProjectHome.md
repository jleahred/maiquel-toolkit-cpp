Here I have my tool box to program with C++.
It's composed by...

## Externals tools: ##
  * PCRE for regular expresions with a small wrapper from Ultimate++
  * YAML from yaml-cpp
  * IBPP for connecting to firebird database

## My tools: ##
  * Signal/Slot template implementation (can anyone live without it?)
  * Sockets for Linux and also for windows
  * DateTime and TimeQuantity
  * Config files with .ini format and a specific recursive format
  * STL containers wrapper with iterators verification
  * LR(n) dynamic parser
  * Minimum qpid/amqp wrapper
  * DSL for finite state machine generators
  * DSL/IDL for c++ class generator with YAML support, qpid support, sstream support

## My Qt tools: ##
  * An editor for my LR(n) parser
