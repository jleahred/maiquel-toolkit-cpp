* Check +release on exit+ formats (names)

* Sockets with async connection (non locking)
* +Call later+ with bigger precission
* +Call later+ checking pending calls. Warning on 50, stop con 500
* Attention to signal/slot and excetions breaking the program flow. Now, when it happends, pending signals will not be call
