*********
* http://www.yaml.org/
* YAML: YAML Ain't Markup Language
* What It Is: YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.
*********

* The integrated library is http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/
* This library is not the best to work with configuration files, for that, use +ConfigFile+
* We can use +YAML+ to save application data (accounts, grants, user lists, etc...)
* The file will have a standard format (no so popular as +xml+)
* +YAML+ is good for humans and good for machines (not like +xml+, bad for humans, bad for machines)
* Documentation about this library... http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/wiki/HowToEmitYAML and http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/wiki/HowToParseADocument

Small example with YAML::

* +map+ will be saved as +list+
* In order to load a map, you have to define the key on it. It will be automatically generated on +build_msg+ tool
** The class has to define +key_type+ type_def  and a   +key_type  get_key(void)+ method
+
[NOTE]
All messages generated by +build_msg+ tool, are integrated with this YAML library +
Look on +build_msg+ for more information

* There is a couple of functions to parse to string and from string
** +string_from_yaml+  will give as a string with +yaml+ format from object
** +parse_from_yaml_string+  will return an instance created from +yaml+ text
** Used on +acs+ db
