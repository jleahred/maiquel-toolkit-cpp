*********
* http://www.yaml.org/
* YAML: YAML Ain't Markup Language
* What It Is: YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.
*********

* The integrated library is http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/
* This library is not the best to work with configuration files, for that, use +ConfigFile+
* We can use +YAML+ to save application datas (accounts, grants, user lists, etc...)
* The file will have a standar format (no so popular as +xml+)
* +YAML+ is good for humans and good for machines (not like +xml+, bad for humans, bad for machines)
* Documentation about this library... http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/wiki/HowToEmitYAML and http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/wiki/HowToParseADocument
