== Introduction

* Starting with +fsm_gen dsl+, this script will generate a couple of files to use on your +cpp+ programs and a +dot+ diagram
* The generated files are +RIIA+ designed
* +fsm_gen dsl+ lets you to define a **F**inite **S**tate **M**achine in a declarative way
* You will have to write +pre-actions, post-actions+, ++guards++ and +initializers+
* This python script uses +dhp+ from +mtk/tools/bin+ to validate and parse the +fsm+ definition
* Let's see an small example...
* To run this tool
** You have to create a symbolic link to +mtk/tools/bin/+ on current folder called +tools+
** After that, you can call it with +tools/fsm_gen.py <files to compile>+
** Or... ++find . -name \'*.fsm\'  |  xargs python tools/fsm_gen.py++
* It can generate a small coverage report calling to +get_coverage_string+
** The report will be generated with a maximum frecuency of 30 secs (if you call more often, it will return the same value as previus call)
** See it on +door7+ example

== Simple DOR example   (DOR 1)

* This is the ++fsm_gen dsl++ defining the finite state machine
+
----
include::examples/simple_dor/simple_dor.fsm[]
----
+
* ++fsm_gen++ will create two files to work on c++
+
* Here it is the +class+ interface generated to use in your program
+
[source,{cpp}]
----
include::examples/simple_dor/generated/simple_dor.h[]
----
+
* Here you have an example of filled +class+ in an small +main+
+
[source,{cpp}]
----
include::examples/simple_dor/main.cpp[]
----
+
* The ++fsm_gen++ script will also generate a ++.dot++ file for ++graphviz++

=== fsm_gen dsl explanation
* This is a very simple example with no guards, few actions, no properties...
--
Sections::
* The sections start with a line ++::SECTION_NAME::++ and end in next section name
+
[NOTE]
This is not fully true. +
Sections starts with +SECION_NAME::+  and ends with +\n::+ +
But looks like starting with +::SECION_NAME::+
+
* Sections has to be in order

INIT::
* We can write some +python+ code.
* This sections is ready to initialize some values (like for example, +NAMESPACE+) for +python+ script

INPUTS::
* Here we have the input information (aka events on +fsm+)
* In this easy case, we don't have parameters
* Inputs cannot have return value
* In this case... +open+ will request the dor to open and +close+...

OUTPUTS::
* These are +signals+ (+mtk::signal<const xxx&>+) that will be fired by the +fsm+
* In this case they don't have params
* Obviously, we want to fire +sig_opened+ when the dor si opened and +sig_closed+ whe dor is closed. We have to fire them on +actions+ code to fill

COMMON_STATUS_INFO::
* Here we can put information (properties) that are common to all status
* The compiler, will put this information in a +mtk::CountPtr+. Therefore information will not be copied
* In this small example, we don't have properties


STATUS::
* We have to write a +::STATUS::+ section per status in our +fsm+
* Each status, can have especific properties +
  This is specialy interesting to work in +RAII+ style


TRANSITIONS::
* Each line is a diferent +transition+
* On left, we have the initial status
* After +--+, we have the +input+ or event
* After +/+ we have the +actions+
* And last, after +-\->+ we have the final +status+
* There are more posibilities and we will see them later (+guards+, +preactions+ and +postactions+)
+
[NOTE]
To make the diagram more clear, it's a good idea to hide some transitions +
Transitions endind with +''>+ instead of +-\->+  will not be draw on diagram

MACROS::
* Here we can write C++ code for our actions or guards
* If no macro is defined on +fsm+ file, the system will write the macro name with prefix +fsmgen__+ on c++ code +
  This lets you write the macros code on your program instead on fsm definition
* This section can be empty

== DOR example with key  (guards and input params)  (DOR 2)

* Now, let's give a key to our dor +
  In order to open or close the dor, you have to provide a valid key
* This is the +fsm_gen dsl+ defining the finite state machine
+
----
include::examples/simple_dor2/simple_dor.fsm[]
----
<1> Input with *parameters*  (in this case one parameter of type +int+)
<2> Equal to 1
<3> Transition with *guard*. +
    This transition will be executed if +guard+ returns +true+
<4> This is the +else+ or +default+ for transition 3
<5> This transiction will be executed when +guard+ returns +true+
<6> Else of transition 5
+
* Here you have an example of filled ++class++ in small main
+
[source,{cpp}]
----
include::examples/simple_dor2/main.cpp[]
----
<1> Now +open+ requires a *param* (the key). +
    In this case with wrong *param*
<2> +open+ with valid *param*
<3> +close+ with grong *param*
<4> +close+ with valid *param*
+
* _Remember_ The ++fsm_gen++ script will also generate a ++.dot++ file for ++graphviz++

== DOR exmaple with postactions  (DOR 3)

* We also can configure _postactions_ +
  These actions will be executed after _status_ changes
+
----
include::examples/simple_dor3/simple_dor.fsm[]
----
<1> _pre_ and *post*  actions separated by comma

== DOR with many features (DOR 4)

* It's time to add a bit of complexity to our dor
* Instead of require a simple password for each user, we will require the password codded with a key generated by dor
* In this example we will introduce many features, sometimes not in best way to do things
+
----
include::examples/simple_dor4/simple_dor.fsm[]
----
<1> Output signal to notify alarms
<2> Adding properties to all status
<3> Adding property to specific status and initialization code
<4> Adding property with sortcut to initialize from requiered param from status constructor
<5> Adding code to constructor
<6> Adding property with specific initialization (no sortcut)
<7> Initializating status with method call
<8> Using predefined +LOGIC_ERROR+ macro to fill all transitions
<9> Macros definition
+
* Constructor code +(4, 5)+, has to be at the end of +status+ definition
* Look that +initializers+ are delimitied by +({ ... })+ and the +code+ is delimited by +[{ ... }]+
* Filling and using it
+
[source,{cpp}]
----
include::examples/simple_dor4/main.cpp[]

+
* _Remember_ The ++fsm_gen++ script will also generate a ++.dot++ file for ++graphviz++
* All +LOGIC_ERROR+ transitions has been removed using +''>+

== Error control

LOGIC_ERROR::
* You can handle easily all ilogical transitions with +LOGIC_ERROR+ macro
* The system will allways generate +sig_alarm+ signal and +LOGIC_ERROR+ automatically
* The macro +LOGIC_ERROR+ will emit +sig_alarm+ (therefore, if you use +LOGIC_ERROR+ macro, you will have to define this output)

Exceptions::
* The generated code, will catch all exceptions and will add status info before rethrowing the exception



== Login access, more logical, less features (DOR 5)

* There are not many diferences bettween a dor control and a login control
* Usually, there is not necessary to apply all features
* In this example, we aren't using +posactions+ (very dangerous)
+
----
include::examples/simple_dor5/simple_dor.fsm[]
----
<1> This is an optional initialization line +
    It's mandatory when the first status (as +logout+) requieres extra parameters
+
* Filling and using it

+
[NOTE]
The gray status indicates the initial status
+
[IMPORTANT]
The properties allways has to be accessed by their access methods +
To get de value  +<method_name>()+ +
To set the value +set_<method_name>(new_value)+
+
* Running this example you can see a *problem* with +session_id+
** +session_id+ is a global property.
** We initialized in one status and we forgot to delete the value when leave this status
** We could try to don't forget to delete, but this is not a very good option.
*** It's very easy to forget
*** It's dificult to detect when we forget it
** The best option has to be +RAII+


== Fixing Login access with PHONY properties  (DOR 6)

Some properties doesn't have sense in all status

Fixing it is very easy

You only have to declare a property with same name in the specific status

But... this is not a full solution. The problem is that... it's very easy to access by mistake to write or read the property from a status that hasn't have this property by logic

* To solve it, +phony+ properties
* +properties+ and +methods+ (inputs and outputs) can have visibility specification
* It could be +public+, +private+ and +phony+ (in properties)
* By default, if you don't specify anything, them will be +public+
* +phony+ means a false property. +
  A +phony+ property never will generate a member +
  You have the oportunity to generate a member on specific status as next example
+

== FAQ

Why generate a +.impl+ file instead a +.cpp+?::
Because the +.impl+ file is part of a +.cpp+ file, is not a full +.cpp+ file and has to be _included_ in final +.cpp+ file

Why to have status names two times, in +::STATUS::+ and in transitions?::
This redundance reduce typing errors. Imagine you write on a transition a status name with a typo error. +
Without the redundance, the system cannot warn you about it and it will create a new false status
